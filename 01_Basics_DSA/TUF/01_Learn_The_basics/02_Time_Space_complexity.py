# calculate the time complexity -

# We will always calculate the time complexity for the worst-case scenario.
# We will avoid including the constant terms.
# We will also avoid the lower values.

# Space Complexity - sumation of Auxiliary space and input space.
# auxiliary space - additional space for solving the problem.
# input space - space we use for storing input values.
